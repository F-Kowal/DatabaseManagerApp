# DatabaseManagerApp
SQL CRUD Project

The Database Manager App is used to manage selected Northwind database tables. The current version (v1.0) supports the Categories, Customers, Employees, Orders, and Products tables.
User interface allows you to easily perform basic CRUD operations on data.
The project was created and is being developed on the .NET platform using WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation).

Make sure to firstly run CreateDatabaseQuery.sql file to create and populate Northwind database,
and if necessary - change SQL connection strings in App.xaml.cs and NorthwindContext.cs.
